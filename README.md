# Marconutrient PDF Emailing Script

This Python script calculates my coaching client's daily macronutrients (protein, fats, and carbohydrates), creates a pdf with the macronutrients split into 4 meals, stores the pdf in my client's file on my computer, and then emails the pdf to my client.

## Why?

As an online fitness coach, one of my tasks is to provide my clients with an updated nutrition sheet at the end of each training and dieting cycle. For instance, I may transition my client from a bulk to a cut, which requires a change in their daily caloric intake. Previously, this process was long and tedious, requiring manual inputs into my google sheets macrocalculator, copying the macronutrient values per meal, creating a new Google document, pasting in the macronutrient values, formating the google document, downloading it as a PDF, storing it in the correct folder on my computer, and finally emailing it to my client. This process typically took around 15 minutes.

With this script, the process now only takes 5 seconds (99.4% faster!). After inputting a few variables, the script calculates the marconutirients per meal, creates a well-formatted PDF with the calculated numbers, organizes the PDF into my client's file on my computer, and emails it to my client.

## How does it work?

Upon initialization, the script prompts for 7 inputs: body weight in (lbs), daily calories (kcal), daily protein (g), fats ratio (0.3-0.4), mesocycle number, phase (Fat Loss, Massing, Maintenance, Deload), and client name. The script then performs calculations to determine daily fats (g), daily carbs (g), macronutrients for 2 regular meals, and macronutrients for pre- and post-workout meals. All calculated numbers are rendered into a Jinja2 HTML file. With PDFkit, this file is used to create a PDF with proper formatting and file names. The client name and mesocycle number determine the path of the PDF storage on my local computer. Additionally, if the path doesn't exist, the script will create a new one (useful for starting a new mesocycle). After the creation of the PDF, the script prompts whether to send the PDF to the client. Given the input of "yes", the script logs into the SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) server with my Gmail creditials and sends a formatted email with a subject, body, and PDF attachment to my client's email (retrieved from a custom dictionary). Finally, the SMTP connection is closed and the script ends.
